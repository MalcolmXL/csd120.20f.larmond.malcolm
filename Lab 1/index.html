    <h1>Welcome to Malcolm’s CSD120 Website!</h1>
<p>
I am currently studying Computer programming at Sault College in Northern Ontario. Becuase of the global panademic
the course is offered online this year.  I have some previous experience with computers mostly by way of DAWs
(Digital Audio Workstations). The last time I actually wrote code was in 1986 on a Atari 400 with the "basic" language
provided by Atari as a free cartrigde. 
</p>
<p>
My goal is too understand as much as I can and find gainful emplowment related to computers.  I have some family connections that may help me get an intership 
at a local business. I am also willing to travel anywehere in Canada to work. Perhaps Vancouver, 
Toronto, or Montreal. That being said, a lot of work is becoming remote in the computer realm so I could also remain here in Sault Ste Marie.
