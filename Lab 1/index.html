    <h1>Welcome to Malcolm’s CSD120 Website!</h1>
<p>
I am currently studying Computer programming at Sault College in Northern Ontario. Becuase if the global panademic
the course is offered online this year.  I have some previous experience with computers mostly by way of DAWs
(Digital Audio Workstations). The last time I actually wrote code was in 1986 on a Atari 400 with the "basic" language
provided by Atari as a free cartrigde. 
</p>
<p>
My goal is too understand as much as I can and find gainful emplowment somewhere, im not sure what feild yet but 
something related to computers.  I have some family connections that may help me get an intership at a local business 
but I am willing to travel anywehere in Canada to work. Perhaps Vancouver, Toronto, or Montreal. That being
said a lot of work is becoming remote in the computer realm.
