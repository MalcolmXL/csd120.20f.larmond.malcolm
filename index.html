      <h1>Welcome to Malcolm’s CSD120 Website!</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently studying Computer programming at Sault College in
        Northern Ontario. Becuase of the global panademic the course is
        offered online this year. I have some previous experience with
        computers mostly by way of DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). The last
        time I actually wrote code was in 1986 on a Atari 400 with the "basic"
        language provided by Atari as a free cartrigde.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is too understand as much as I can and find gainful emplowment
        related to computers. I have some family connections that may help me
        get an intership at a local business. I am also willing to travel
        anywehere in Canada to work. Perhaps Vancouver, Toronto, or Montreal.
        That being said, a lot of work is becoming remote in the computer
        realm so I could also remain here in Sault Ste Marie.

        Computers and electronic music are not the opposite of the warm
        human music. It's exactly the same.
